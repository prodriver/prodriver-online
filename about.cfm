          The idea was truly born of necessity from every entertainment coach leasing company in America. After a two-year process of questioning different candidates, we arrived at the answer. We needed a single source of available drivers that we could call from in case of emergency. Drivers who participate in this program are prescreened, drug tested, DOT certified and have years of experience in the motorcoach industry. <br>
          <br>
          Owner and founder of ProDriver, Phil Dunlap, a twenty plus year veteran of the entertainer transportation industry, knows the issues all coach operators face year after year. From early beginnings, with a family business of twenty coaches, Phil worked through the business as a driver for many years. He has managed and consulted for many of the top companies in the country and owns a small company of lease vehicles and limousines. "This is something we have all needed for a long time,&quot; he states. It doesn't matter if your driver has worked for you for years and isn't looking for another job, if they want to supplement their income with team drives, or pick up a little holiday cash moving equipment around the country, it's worth the effort to join our website. And membership is just less than a day's pay! <br>
